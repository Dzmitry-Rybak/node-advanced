# Node.js Advanced Concepts Course

This course dives deep into advanced Node.js concepts to become a top-tier Node engineer. It covers essential topics like:

- **Node Event Loop**: Gain a clear understanding of how Node.js executes your code and the Event Loop, an essential topic for both interviews and performance optimization.
- **Caching with Redis**: Improve database query performance by adding Redis-backed caching, even if you're new to Redis.
- **Scalable File Uploads**: Learn to implement a scalable file upload solution using AWS S3, perfect for handling millions of users.
- **Continuous Integration Testing**: Master testing with Puppeteer, Jest, and Travis CI, ensuring your app functions correctly with automated tests.

Along the way, I've learn advanced JavaScript techniques and best practices for building scalable, high-performance Node.js applications.

Key learning outcomes:

- Master the Node Event Loop
- Boost app performance with clustering and worker threads
- Turbocharge MongoDB queries using Redis caching
- Scale your app with AWS S3 for file uploads
- Implement automated testing and continuous integration
